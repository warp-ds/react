import { Breadcrumbs } from '../src';

# Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs show the navigation structure for the current location.

## Import

```js
import { Breadcrumbs } from '@warp-ds/react';
```

## Example

```jsx example
<Breadcrumbs>
  <a href="#/url/1">Eiendom</a>
  <a href="#/url/2">Bolig til salgs</a>
  <span aria-current="page">
    Oslo
  </span>
</Breadcrumbs>
```

## Content

Breadcrumbs expect their component children to be the link "crumbs" that make up
the navigation structure. The component will interject a separator between the
crumbs.

## Accessibility

Breadcrumbs should have a label that identifies the structure as a breadcrumb
trail to screen readers. By default, `aria-label` is set to <em>"Her er
du"</em>.

It is recommended that the crumb for the current page has the
`aria-current="page"` attribute set. Usually this is the last crumb in the
trail.

## Props

```props packages/breadcrumbs/src/component.tsx

```
